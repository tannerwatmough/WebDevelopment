This folder contains all web development projects. Some projects may be directly implemented in the live sites at https://www.tannerselman.com, https://www.thepsfoundation.ca, or https://www.tannerwatmough.com. The actual website repositories can be found in the repositories as indicated by their descriptions. \n
This repository includes both projects from online courses (The Odin Project, FreeCodeCamp, etc.) and also personal projects I'm working on related to Web Development.
