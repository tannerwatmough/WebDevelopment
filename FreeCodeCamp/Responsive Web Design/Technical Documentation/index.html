          <p>Python is an easy to use programming language that is frequently used in data science and scientific disciplines. It is also popular among Computer Scientists in the Machine Learning field.</p>
          <p>Python does abstract some important computer science topics from the user such as memory allocation. It is also a interpreted language which means it can run slower than programs that are compiled like C and C++.</p>

            <li>x = 5;</li>
            <li>x is the variable above</li>
            <li>x now contains the number 5</li>

        <article>
          <p>Conditionals are if statements that will only execute the program if certain conditions, hence conditionals, are met.</p>
          <code>if x < 3 do:</code>
          <br />
          <code class="indent">print("Hello")</code>
          <p>In this case, the code would only run if the variable x was less than 3. If x was less than 3, the console would print out the statement "Hello".</p>

        <article>
          <p>Loops will continue executing sequentially but loop around at the end of the loop until the loop has a break/end command or meets a conditional.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>while True:</li>
            <li>This is a common way to form a pseudo-infinite loop to keep a program running until the program is exitted or terminated.</li>
            <li>Loops can contain conditionals that might lead to the termination of the loop or program.</li>
          </ul>
          <code>while True do:</code>
          <br />
          <code class="indent">if x > 3 do:</code>
          <br />
          <code class="dbl-indent">x = x - 1</code>
          <br />
          <code class="indent">else:</code>
          <br />
          <code class="dbl-indent">exit</code>
          <p>In this case, the loop would continue until x < 3, at which point it would exit the loop and end the program.</p>

          <p>Python can be a great first language to learn, especially if theoretical computer science and dealing with memory scares you.</p>
          <p>But python will abstract quite a bit away from the user so most Universities will not use Python after introductory courses, instead choosing C, C++, or Java.</p>
